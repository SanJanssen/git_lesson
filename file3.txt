For spousal sponsorships, make sure you include a valid marriage certificate or proof of registration of your marriage with your application (see checklist details). The document(s) you submit must show that the marriage was legally registered with the government where it took place.

A record of solemnization (obtained in Canada) or marriage license will not be accepted as proof that the sponsor and applicant are married.

Check the country specific requirements to see if there are specific instructions for the country where the marriage took place.
